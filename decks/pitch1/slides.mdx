## Problem

* Safe sharing of local devices with URLs
  * post it in Zoom et al. chat,  or email, or...
* Pool them to accurately synchronize actions
  * on +100K devices across the world
* Control them with autonomous agents
* Integrate them with AR/VR

## Challenges

* Market fragmentation
* Software complexity
* Cloud cost
* Monetization strategy

### Market fragmentation

---

<CafjsHeader/>

### Software complexity


* Security
* Reliability
* Management
  * Updating, deploying, monitoring,...

---

<CafjsHeader/>

### Cloud cost

  * A reliable automomous agent that
    * wakes up once a second,
    * computes for one millisecond,
    * and checkpoints 500 bytes
  * Total of more than **$144 per year** per device
    * *Google Cloud Run*: $88 per year
    * *Google Cloud Firestore*: $56 per year

### Monetization strategy

* Install **yet another** native app syndrome
* Paid app? Really?
* In-app advertisement or purchases?
  * Low engagement time

## Our solution

Share local devices with just your phone and a browser

Caf.js Framework + Custom Platform -> Caf.js Cloud

---

<CafjsHeader/>

### Market fragmentation

* Our customers are an army of independent programmers,
    * some as young as 12 years old,
    * scattered around the globe
* No job is too small


---

<CafjsHeader/>

### Software complexity

* Focus on JavaScript programmers
  * No Cloud or embedded experience
  * Standard chrome tools
* Client/Cloud/Device handled as a single unit
  * Emulate cloud and device on your laptop
  * Build with one command
  * Deploy in the cloud one container image
* Transparently providing reliability, security, and management

---

<CafjsHeader/>

### Cloud cost

  * Our Gold plan is **$0.85 per year**
    * Same reliable autonomous agent but
    * two orders of magnitude cheaper!
  * Baseline app maintenance cost is about **$6 per year**
  * Secret sauce
    * Custom platform codesigned with the framework

### Monetization strategy

---

<CafjsHeader/>

## Our revenue model

3x infrastructure costs

What we make is not based on what the programmer makes

---

<CafjsHeader/>

### Not a Nanny Store

* Programmer decides what percentage of revenue is profit
* Alternatives to monetize your web app
  * Your own in-app purchase scheme,
  * or forward to your website for subscriptions
* No explicit approvals
  * but should follow our terms and conditions
