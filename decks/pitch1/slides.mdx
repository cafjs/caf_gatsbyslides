## Problem

* Safe sharing of local devices with URLs
  * post it in Zoom et al. chat,  or email, or...
* Pool them to accurately synchronize actions
  * on +100K devices across the world
* Control them with autonomous agents
* Integrate them with AR/VR

### Cloud cost

  * A reliable automomous agent that
    * wakes up once a second,
    * computes for one millisecond,
    * and checkpoints 500 bytes
  * Costs more than **$144 per year**
    * *Google Cloud Run*: $88 per year
    * *Google Cloud Firestore*: $56 per year

### Monetization strategy

* Install **yet another** native app syndrome
* Paid app? Really?
* In-app advertisement or purchases?
  * Low engagement time

## Our solution

Share local devices with just your phone and a browser

Caf.js Framework + Custom Platform -> Caf.js Cloud

---

<CafjsHeader/>

### Market fragmentation

* Our customers are an army of independent programmers,
    * some as young as 12 years old,
    * scattered around the globe
* No job is too small


---

### Software complexity

* Focus on JavaScript programmers
  * No Cloud or embedded experience
  * Standard chrome tools
* Client/Cloud/Device handled as a single unit
  * Emulate cloud and device on your laptop
  * Build and deploy in the cloud **one** container image
* Transparently providing reliability, security, and management

---

<CafjsHeader/>

### Cloud cost

  * Our Gold plan is **$0.85 per year**
    * Same reliable autonomous agent but
    * two orders of magnitude cheaper!
  * Baseline app maintenance cost is about **$6 per year**
  * Secret sauce
    * Custom platform codesigned with the framework
    * Incubator mode

### Monetization strategy with Caf.js Cloud

* Manage subscription payments per device
  * Take a cut for infrastructure,
  * give the rest to the programmer,
  * and flex resources based on #devices and plan
* Like an app store but
  * providing your back-end,
  * and using the browser (Web App)
* **Profit-as-you-go** not pay-as-you-go

## Caf.js Cloud

---

<CafjsHeader/>

### Our revenue model

At least 3x infrastructure costs

What we make is not based on what the programmer makes

---

<CafjsHeader/>

### Not a Nanny Store

* Programmer decides what percentage of revenue is profit
* Alternatives to monetize your web app
  * Your own in-app purchase scheme,
  * or forward to your website for subscriptions
* No explicit approvals
  * but should follow our terms and conditions

### Bootstrapping an App with No Money

* A few free units when you sign up
  * No credit card or bank account
* Deploy your app
* Friends register for your app
  * one unit (10Â¢ + fees) per week is orbital velocity
* Grow with profit-as-you-go
* Transfer units for real money
  * Any peer-to-peer payment system
---

### What this Means...

* A kid in Nigeria,
  * with <ins>zero</ins> financing,
  * can create a very profitable,
  * and sustainable business,
  * purely based on <ins>talent</ins>
